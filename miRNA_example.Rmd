# We have the following miRNA-sequencing datasets:

## blood_oc_merged_raw_summed.rds:
1. healthy controls
2. ovarian cancer patients - different stages (i.e. I/II and III/IV) and tumor types (i.e. serous and clear cell)

## batch4_raw_summed.rds:
1. healthy controls
2. patients at high risk (HR) for developing ovarian cancer (based on either family history or BRCA mutation)

Here, we build a model using the healthy controls and ovarian cancer samples from the 1st dataset and healthy controls from the 2nd dataset.
